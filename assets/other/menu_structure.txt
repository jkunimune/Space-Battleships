faqs
text%body%Q: How can those lasers be bigger than the earth?
text%body%A: They're not - it seems that way because auto-targeting.
text%body%Q: Where do the ships get their energy?
text%body%A: Solar power.
text%body%Q: Why don't ships expend energy when they stop?
text%body%A: They put that energy in reserve so that they don't end up drifting into space.
text%body%Q: Then shouldn't they get that energy back if they change direction mid-flight?
text%body%A: No. They have to completely stop before changing direction.
text%body%Q: Why? That seems inefficient.
text%body%A: The ships can't handle the calculations otherwise.
text%body%Q: Aren't they on some hi-tech futuristic ships? It really isn't that hard of a calculation...
text%body%A: It is if you ignore relativity and consider time as a linear progression from cause to effect.
text%body%Q: ?
text%body%A: Actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey, stuff.
text%body%Q: ... no words ...
